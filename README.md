# Ramen

**ramen** is the rust static site generator for からつばLABS hosted anime
and manga.

## USAGE

compile and run **ramen**:
```
$ rustc ramen.rs
$ ./ramen
```

## TODO

- [ ] rewrite builder pattern (a lot of duplicated code)
- [ ] support decimal episode numbers (rust doesn't have Ord on f32?)
